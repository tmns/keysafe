# KeySafe

A simple safe for storing all your passwords / keys. Not associated with the Android app. Under heavy construction!

So far, the backend server / REST API has been implemented. You can:

- Register a user
- Update a user
- Delete a user
- Authenticate
- Create a group (ie, category of keys)
- Edit a group
- Delete a group
- Create a key
- Edit a key
- Delete a key

Next up is the frontend!
